# LDK Node Flutter Workshop

This is a workshop to learn how to build a Lightning Network wallet app using the [Lightning Development Kit](https://lightningdevkit.org) (LDK) in Flutter by making use of the [ldk_node](https://pub.dev/packages/ldk_node) package developed by [Let there be Lightning](https://ltbl.io).

## Audience

This workshop is targeted at software developers.
Mobile developers and especially Flutter developers will benefit the most from this workshop, but anyone with a basic understanding of programming and a willingness to learn can participate.

Although mobile and especially Flutter developers will benefit the most from this workshop, experience with mobile development is **NOT** required.
Also knowledge about Bitcoin and the Lightning Network itself is helpful, but **NOT** required.

We think the workshop can be fun and a great learning experience for both developers that want to learn about Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, as well as Bitcoin and Lightning developers that want to learn about mobile development.

## Goal

The main goal of this workshop is to introduce you to the Lightning Development Kit (LDK) and the `ldk_node` package and get you familiar with its capabilities, APIs and the basic concepts of building a Lightning Network compatible wallet app in Flutter.
