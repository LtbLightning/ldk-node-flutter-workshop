# Instructor Guide

## Formats to conduct the workshop

As an instructor or coordinator, you can conduct this workshop in different ways depending on the audience and time available. You can live code yourself or let the participants dive in themselves for a more hands-on experience.

### Live coding

One way is to live code while the participants follow along. You can use the [instructions](INSTRUCTIONS.md) yourself as a guide in this case and look at the [solutions](SOLUTIONS.md) as to what to code next, while explaining the concepts and code to the participants as you go along.

The approach might be more apt as an introduction for developers with less experience with Flutter and/or Bitcoin and that need to be walked through the workshop.
This might be better time boxed since you can control the pace if you have limited time.

### Hands-on

Another way is to shortly explain the concepts and then let the participants follow the [instructions](INSTRUCTIONS.md) and let them implement the code themselves, while you are available for questions and to make sure everyone gets through the workshop.

This approach is more hands-on and might be best suited for developers that are sufficiently familiar with Flutter and Bitcoin and want to learn by doing.
This approach might require more time for the participants to figure out the code and LDK Node APIs themselves.

### Mix

A mix of both approaches is also possible. You could start with the first approach and then switch to the second approach after the participants have a basic understanding of the concepts and the flow of the workshop.
